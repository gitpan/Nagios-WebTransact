Class to simplify the generation of Nagios service checks of Web
transactions.

Web transactions are sequences of fill out forms through which a
user interacts with a database search engine or a registration
service.

A successfull transaction is characterised by successfull
traversing each fill out form ie by each form returning both the
expected values (pattern) and not returning patterns that
characterise faults.

The class offers limited ability to respond to dynamic web pages.
