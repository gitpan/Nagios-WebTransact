Revision history for Perl extension Nagios::WebTransact

0.01  Fri May 30 15:35:55 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19

0.0.2 Correct testing. Try and limp along with no understanding of
      Test::Harness and make test. Rather unsuccessfull.

0.0.3 Since make test runs 
	- test.pl and
	- t/* with verbose=0

then the choices for prompting are either put all code in test.pl (Schwern says is bad) or
what has been done here ie

	- construct credentials cache with Makefile.PL and 
	- put all the tests in t/
