Revision history for Perl extension Nagios::WebTransact

0.01  Fri May 30 15:35:55 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19

0.02 Correct testing. Try and limp along with no understanding of
      Test::Harness and make test. Rather unsuccessfull.

0.03 Since make test runs 
	- test.pl and
	- t/* with verbose=0

then the choices for prompting are either put all code in test.pl (Schwern says is bad) or
what has been done here ie

	- construct credentials cache with Makefile.PL and 
	- put all the tests in t/

0.04	Add PREREQ checking to Makefile.PL ..

0.14	Nov 2003
	- closure generated accessors 
 	- add download_images option

0.15	Cache UserAgent in object making it possible to reuse the object ($x->urls([({Method =>,..})]))
	with a different set of pages.

	Obviously the object design is completely unsatisfactory: constructor should cache UserAgent;
	check() should take the list of pages and check them.

0.16	Mar 2004 XXXX
	1 Unnecessary change to default AGENT value 
	2 allow redirect for POST. This breaks the check_sap* clients.

	==> backout and document the agent keyword of the check method.
